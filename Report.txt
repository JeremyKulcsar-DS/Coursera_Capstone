Introduction / Business Problem

Bangkok, Thailand, has always been a city of wonders where anything could be found. There is everything for everyone: restaurants, street food, clubs, bars, temples, museums, malls, parks, rooftops, pools, sun...
Opening a restaurant as an expat could be a good idea: other expats of the same nation would come to eat their native food, and thai locals would come to try our exotic food. However, Bangkok is a huge city, and each district has its own demographics and specialties.
The aim of this data science project is to help locate the best district to open our restaurant.

Data

As Bangkok is a very metropolitan city with a very diversified population and choice of restaurants, we can make the hypothesis that the nature of the demographics in the district doesn't matter.
The Foursquare location data is therefore enough for this study: we will be able to locate which places are the most suited for opening a restaurant based on their activity there: do they already have many restaurants at that location? Is it rather a coffee/bar street, a restaurant one, or a club one? etc...
