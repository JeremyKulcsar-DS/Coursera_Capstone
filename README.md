Project name: Finding the best district in Bangkok to open a foreign restaurant

This is a recreational project done for the IBM Data Science course.

The notebook and report were done in less than a few hours, which means the results discussed in this project are very superficial, and the overall project is not representative of the quality of my actual work.
